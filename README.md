# Credit Card Customer Segmentation: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Analysis
In this project, the role of a data scientist at a credit card company is assumed. The task involves analyzing a dataset containing information about the company’s clients, with the aim of segmenting them into distinct groups. This segmentation will allow the company to tailor different business strategies to each customer group.

The company expects a segment for every client, accompanied by a detailed explanation of each group’s characteristics and the key factors that differentiate them.

During a planning session with the Data Science coordinator, it was decided to use the K-means algorithm for the segmentation process.

To effectively apply this algorithm and meet the company’s objectives, the following steps will be taken:

- Analyze the dataset;
- Prepare the data for modeling;
- Determine the optimal number of clusters;
- Perform the segmentation;
- Interpret and explain the results.
